# gmail_filter_manager

Gmail filer manager using YAML format.

## Requirement

Python packages:

- ruamel.yaml (`pip install ruamel.yaml`)

## Installation

If you are using Mac and [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew),
you can install by:

```
$ brew install rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac/gmail_filter_manager
```

Otherwise, you can use install script on the web like:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/gmail_filter_manager/install/install.sh| sh
```

This will install scripts to `/usr/bin`
and you may be asked root password.

If you want to install other directory, do like:

```
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/rcmdnk/gmail_filter_manager/install/install.sh|  prefix=~/usr/local/ sh
```

Or, simply download scripts in bin/ and place where you like.

## Scripts

### gfm_extract

A script to convert mailFilters.xml, which can be exported from Gmail,
to YAML format.

Default input name is **mailFilters.xml**.
Default ouput name is **mailFilters.yaml**.

They can be changed by arguments:

```
$ gfm_extract [input name [output name]]
```

Once you have YAML file,
you can edit it and use it as an input for `gfm_make`.

### gfm_make

A script to make XML of filters to be imported in Gmail.

Input is YAML format.

Default input name is **mailFilters.yaml**.
Default ouput name is **mailFilters.yaml**.

```yaml
filters:
- from: "foo@example.com"
  lable: "foo"
- subject: "[test]"
  lable: "test"
  shouldMarkAsRead: "true"
namespaces:
  apps: http://schemas.google.com/apps/2006
  atom: http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom
```

**namespaces** can be omitted.
It is included if you use `gfm_extract`,
but it will be automatically added by `gfm_make` even if is omitted.

## Filter Tips

### Numbering labels

Gmail's labels are sorted automatically.

But you may want to put some labels such **Work**, which is always at the bottom,
on the top.

To do it, you can set prefix numbers on labels.

- 01_Work
- 02_Private
- 03_Others

Then, these labels are listed in this order.

### Use labels like folder

Gmail has only **label**, but some other mail clients have **folder**.

- Label: User can set several labels on the same message.
- Folder: A message is included only in one folder.

And all filters are always applied to the new mail.

In this case, if the mail is caught by several filters for labels,
several labels are set.

To avoid several labels to use it as **folder**,
**has:nouserlabels** keyword is useful.

If **hasTheWord** includes this keyword,
only the mail which still does not have the label can be caught.

e.g.)

```
filters:
- hasTheWord: "from:foo@example.com"
  label: "00_foo"
- hasTheWord: "has:nouserlabels from:example.com"
  label: "01_example"
  shouldArchive: "true"
- hasTheWord: "has:nouserlabels"
  label: "09_others"
  shouldArchive: "true"
```

These filters put a label **foo** for mails from **foo@example.com**,
and put a label **example** for mails from **example.com** domain other than **foo@example.com**.
In addition, if it is not from **foo**, the mail is archived.

And the last filter send other mails to **others** label,
and skip the Inbox.
Such a filter make you free from notification bombs
in the Gmail app of a cell phone.

To use such filters, the order is important.

Note: If you modify filters in the Gmail web interface,
the order is changed: the modified one goes to the bottom.

This is one of the reasons why I wanted these scripts.

### Use DummyInbox to leave only specific mails in the Inbox

You may have more labels with which mails must skip the Inbox.

In this case, **DummyInbox** method label can be used instead of
setting **shouldArchive: "true"** for filters.

The setting is like this:

```
filters:
- hasTheWord: "from:foo@example.com"
  label:
  - "00_foo"
  - "99_DummyInbox"
- hasTheWord: "from:example.com"
  label:
  - "01_example"
  - "99_DummyInbox"
- hasTheWord: "from:example2.com"
  label: "02_example2"
- hasTheWord: "from:example3.com"
  label: "03_example3"
- hasTheWord: "from:example4.com"
  label: "04_example4"
- hasTheWord: "from:example5.com"
  label: "05_example5"
- hasTheWord: "has:nouserlabels"
  label: "09_others"
- hasTheWord: "-label:99_DummyInbox"
  shouldArchive: "true"
```

This setting put additional **99_DummyInbox** label
to which you want to remain in the Inbox.

And the final filter archives mails without **99_DummyInbox** label.

In the above setting, **has:nouserlabels** is not used for **from:example.com**.
Therefore the mail from **foo@example.com** has two labels.

The main difference from
[Use labels like folder](https://github.com/rcmdnk/gmail_filter_manager#use-labels-like-folder) method
is that you can put two different labels between them archive policies are different.

If **shouldArchive** is in the each label, all mails associated to the label are archived.
But this method can remain what you want easily.

In addition, only the order of the filters can be free other than the last label,
so that it makes easy to modify with the web interface.
Although you still need to "modify"
**hasTheWord: "-label:99_DummyInbox"** filter after any other filter changes...
(such adding one space in **Has the words** and save, and remove the space and save again...)
